Push Model

1. Make a list for each user for all of his new feeds
2. If a user sends out a new feed, then this new feed will be added into his followers' news feed list (FAN OUT)


Complexity:
1. News Feed => 1 DB reads
2. Post a news feed => N followers, N DB writes

Advantage:
1. Asynchronous tasks in the backend, no need for user to wait

Scale for PUSH
1. Put more new feeds into disk; disk is CHEAP!
2. Rank followers by weight so that we can eliminate inactive users
3. followers > following


Pull Model

1. When user is reading feeds, get all of his followers' first 100 feeds, and then combine to get the final 100 feeds based on time

Complexity:
1. News Feed => N 个关注对象， N DB reads
2. Post a tweet => 1 DB writes

Scale for PULL
1. Cache before DB
2. Cache each user's timeline; no need to cache all\
3. Cache each user's news feed
